# Fire-base-Train-Scheduler
This application allows users to view the times of any train they desire, once they provide some basic initial information. 
It even does so in real-time! It also saves the information on previous train searches so users don't have to worry about losing the info if they forget it, they can also refresh the page to see updated schedules.
Happy travels!
